Today I updated the "Allocator.h". This is a simple packet of the malloc() and free() functions.
However, this header file can help with memory leaks and dangling pointers.
That does not means you can just allocate memory and don't release them.(In this case the performance of the allocator will drop rapidly.)
It is just an ensurance  that in case you forget to release or you can't release on time. And you should always remember to use the del() in the header file.
