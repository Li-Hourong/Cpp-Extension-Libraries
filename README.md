# C++ Extension Libraries
/*
This is a bunch of libraries written in C++.
On the internet, so many people talk about the advantages and disadvantages of C++. And the most serious one is that C++ is getting more and more complicated. There're too many features that make C++ difficult to study and use. So I decided to not use some of the features of C++.
At the same time, many people talk about the lack of C++ open sourse libraries, so I decide to DIY some by myself.
So this is just a place to store my projects.
